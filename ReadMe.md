Portfolio Project

This is the beginning of my portfolio project.  I'm starting with just a readme  and an index.html file.  I'll add the CSS and JS files soon 
and start building the page.  First, as I'm following the assignment, I'll initialize a repository, add the files, and make a commit of
this project, and then push it to GitHub.
