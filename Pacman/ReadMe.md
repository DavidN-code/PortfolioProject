This is my Cooding Dojo Web Fundamentals project 

Pacman
This is from a Chris Courses tutorial on Youtube and is mostly Java Script.
I wanted to expand and add more to the game, but the tutorial stopped where it did, so
since time was limited, I decided to practice HTML and CSS.  I couldn't figure out how to 
add music through Java Script, but it was easy for me to get it to work in HTMl with the
audio control element.  I still have a few more hours before class so I'm going to see
what else I can add to it in HTML and CSS.

I added an API that fetches jokes, a gif that changes to a different gif when clicked on, and at the bottom, I added 
five div circles that change background color with hovering the mouse over them.  Also, on the mouseout, the 
text of a smile face shows up on each circle.
