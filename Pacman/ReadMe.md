This is my Cooding Dojo Web Fundamentals project 

Pacman

This is from a Chris Courses tutorial on Youtube and is mostly Java Script.

I added an API that fetches jokes, a gif that changes to a different gif when clicked on, and at the bottom, I added 
five div circles that change background color with hovering the mouse over them.  Also, on the mouseout, the 
text of a smile face shows up on each circle.
